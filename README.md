This is my personal blog. This Jekyll theme uses the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. So, if you want to use this theme for your blog, feel free to do so. You will have to remove or edit some files, as this is not in a directly exportable format. 

### How to deploy this in a local environment?

Please check the `Makefile`. Important point to note that is I use Podman instead of Docker.
